Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate the request for more transparency regarding the AI analysis process.

To address your concern about the reliability of the machine learning model's output—especially in relation to potential discrepancies introduced by OCR or TTS—here is a clarification:

Text Layer Availability (No OCR Needed in Most Cases):
In practice, over 99% of the PDFs processed through our platform already contain a native, machine-readable text layer. This means that the AI module can directly extract the exact content of the original document without relying on OCR. In such cases, there is no risk of mismatch between the visual content and the analyzed text.

Fallback OCR (Tesseract):
In the rare event (less than 1%) that a PDF lacks a usable text layer—typically due to scanned pages—we fall back to Tesseract OCR, an industry-standard, open-source OCR engine developed by Google.
Tesseract is highly accurate for clean, typed documents and supports multiple languages. Its accuracy on high-resolution, standard-format documents is generally estimated at above 98%. To further increase reliability, we preprocess documents (e.g. binarization, de-skewing) before running OCR.
