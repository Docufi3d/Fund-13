# Technical Documentation

The technical documentation provides a detailed description of all functions but cannot include direct deep links to specific features, as these are only accessible after logging into the system.
To still allow reviewers to verify the functionality, three options are available:

[Login & Test](https://docufi3d.com/register) – Register and test the functions directly in the live system.

[Video Walkthrough](https://docufi3d.com/videos/Demo.mp4) – Use the provided walkthrough video that demonstrates the main workflows step by step.

[Video Call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1iINpEhc1s4SRtbnF1w-ZNd_yymzSINrff-HWBnayWHO2uSF1dt5ObWteMmqg7GfMDi4DmYC4N) (A. Product Development, Acceptance 1, G) – If open questions remain, a dedicated video call will be arranged. This call must take place no later than one week after the milestone is achieved.  Please book a Meeting with dennis@docufi3d.com
