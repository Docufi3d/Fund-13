## Output 2: AI-driven Contract Analysis ##

**Output 2 C**

**Docufi3d branded** example NDA files for AI driven contract analysis and intermediate process outputs for reference:

The scope of this proposal does not cover file naming conventions, the content of sample NDAs, or the definition of contractual parties. Docufi3d is designed as a platform for clients to analyze their own contracts, so a sample agreement between Docufi3d and a third party would not represent a relevant use case. The milestone focuses solely on demonstrating how our AI highlights and analyzes key clauses in standard contracts, which has been successfully shown.
